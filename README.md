# Horiseon Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to have the codebase follow accessibility standards. This project was build so that the website is optimized for search engines. I learned how to view the code and be able to change any of the code to structured HTML elements. Such as adding the alt attribute to the image elements, have the headings attributes fall in swquential order.
